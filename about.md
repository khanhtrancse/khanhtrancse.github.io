## About me
    
Hey guys (gals), I'm Khanh Tran Quoc - a junior developer. I live in Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam with two cats and a old laptop. I was worked as Android developer and currently I am learning Javascript and related Frameworks (React, React Native and Nodejs).

I desire to become the best developer in my field so I spend many time for learning about code, design pattern, architecture, devOps,... but my knowledge is still limited (English).

If you want to contact me, you can message me via Facebook or Twitter.

## Why do I write this blog?

This blog is place to write anything I was learned and I was interested from technologies to experiences in my life. 

I write this blog for other purpose that is improved my English. My English is not good so if I make mistakes, please ignore that. I am very glad if you can report when I write something wrong.
