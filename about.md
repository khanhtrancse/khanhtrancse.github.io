## About me
    
Hey guys (gals), I'm Khanh Tran Quoc - a junior developer. I have lived in Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam with two cats. I have worked as Android developer (Java) and currently I am learning Javascript and related Frameworks (ReactJS, React Native and Nodejs).

I desire to become the best developer so I spend many time for learning about code, design pattern, architecture, devOps,... but my knowledge is still poor.

If you want to contact me, you can message me via Facebook.


## Why do I write this blog?

I write this blog for many purpose such as: log what I learned, impove my English skilll, improve present skill,...

In this blog, I will write about both technology and my experience.
